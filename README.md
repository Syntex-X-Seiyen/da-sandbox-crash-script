A scrp to crash da sandbox!! (must have python 3)

# How to instoll
1. Visit https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download the latest version python
2. Install python
3. Open the script, in the script you will see 2 options, 1 crash all servers, 2 crash any available server that is running at the moment
4. Once you select one of those options you will see the game slowing down until the server shuts down
5. If the servers won't go down reinstall python and try the 1 option
